# Project 6b: Attention

This project, hosted on [Harvard's CS50 AI website](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/6/attention/), delves into the concept of attention in artificial intelligence. Attention mechanisms allow models to focus on specific parts of input, enhancing their performance in various tasks like language translation and image recognition.

## Key Points:

- **Introduction to Attention:** The project begins with an overview of attention mechanisms, explaining how they work and why they're essential in AI models.
  
- **Implementation of Attention:** Participants get hands-on experience implementing attention mechanisms in Python, utilizing libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

- **Applications:** The project explores practical applications of attention mechanisms, highlighting their significance in tasks like language translation, image captioning, and more.

- **Exercises and Challenges:** Learners engage with exercises and challenges designed to deepen their understanding of attention mechanisms and their implementation.

- **Final Project:** The culmination of the project involves applying attention mechanisms to a real-world problem, demonstrating proficiency in utilizing attention for improved AI performance.

## Learning Objectives:

- Understand the fundamentals of attention mechanisms in AI.
