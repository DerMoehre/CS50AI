# Project 3: Crossword

The [Crossword project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/3/crossword/) on Harvard's CS50 AI website focuses on solving crossword puzzles using constraint satisfaction techniques. Participants explore constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and develop algorithms capable of efficiently solving crossword puzzles by considering constraints such as word length and intersecting words.

## Key Components:

- **Introduction to Crossword Puzzles:** The project introduces crossword puzzles as a popular form of word game, highlighting their structure and rules.

- **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs):** Participants learn about CSPs and their application in solving crossword puzzles, where variables represent word positions and domains represent possible words.

- **Word Selection Strategies:** Learners explore various strategies for selecting words to fill in crossword puzzle grids, considering constraints and maximizing word compatibility.

- **Backtracking Search:** The project introduces backtracking search algorithms, which systematically explore possible word placements while respecting puzzle constraints.

- **Efficiency Techniques:** Participants explore techniques for optimizing crossword puzzle solving algorithms, such as constraint propagation and variable ordering heuristics.

- **Final Project:** The culmination of the project involves implementing a crossword puzzle solver capable of efficiently solving a range of crossword puzzles, showcasing proficiency in constraint satisfaction techniques.

## Learning Objectives:

- Understand the structure and rules of crossword puzzles.
- Represent crossword puzzles as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs).
- Implement backtracking search algorithms for solving crossword puzzles efficiently.
- Explore word selection strategies and constraint propagation techniques for optimizing puzzle solving.
- Develop a crossword puzzle solver capable of solving a variety of puzzles.

The Crossword project provides learners with practical experience in constraint satisfaction techniques and algorithmic problem-solving, equipping them with skills applicable to a range of puzzle-solving and optimization tasks.
