# Project 4a: Shopping

The [Shopping project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/4/shopping/) on Harvard's CS50 AI website focuses on developing recommendation systems for online shopping. Participants explore various techniques in machine learning and collaborative filtering to create personalized recommendations for users based on their shopping behavior and preferences.

## Key Features:

- **Introduction to Recommendation Systems:** The project introduces recommendation systems and their importance in enhancing user experience and driving sales in e-commerce platforms.

- **Dataset Exploration:** Participants explore and preprocess datasets containing user shopping behavior, product details, and user preferences, preparing them for recommendation system development.

- **Content-Based Filtering:** Learners delve into content-based filtering techniques, which recommend items to users based on the characteristics of the items and user preferences.

- **Collaborative Filtering:** The project explores collaborative filtering algorithms, which recommend items to users based on similarities in user behavior and preferences.

- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Participants train recommendation models using machine learning techniques such as nearest neighbors or matrix factorization, and evaluate model performance using metrics like precision and recall.

- **Final Project:** The culmination of the project involves building a recommendation system that provides personalized shopping recommendations to users, showcasing proficiency in machine learning and recommendation algorithms.

## Learning Objectives:

- Understand the role and significance of recommendation systems in e-commerce platforms.
- Preprocess and explore datasets for developing recommendation systems.
- Implement content-based and collaborative filtering techniques for personalized recommendations.
- Train recommendation models using machine learning algorithms and evaluate their performance.
- Develop a personalized shopping recommendation system tailored to user preferences and behavior.

The Shopping project equips participants with practical skills in developing recommendation systems for online shopping platforms, enabling them to create personalized shopping experiences for users and drive engagement and sales.
