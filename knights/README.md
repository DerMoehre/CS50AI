# Project 1a: Knights

The [Knights project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/1/knights/) on Harvard's CS50 AI website focuses on solving the Knights and Knaves logic puzzle. Participants explore propositional logic and logical reasoning to determine the identities of individuals based on their statements, where Knights always tell the truth and Knaves always lie.

## Key Components:

- **Introduction to Knights and Knaves:** The project introduces the Knights and Knaves puzzle, where individuals make statements about themselves and others, revealing their identities.

- **Propositional Logic:** Participants learn about propositional logic and logical operators such as AND, OR, and NOT, which are used to represent statements and draw logical conclusions.

- **Logical Reasoning:** Learners explore techniques for reasoning about statements made by Knights and Knaves, identifying contradictions and inferring the identities of individuals based on their statements.

- **Solver Implementation:** The project covers the implementation of a solver capable of determining the identities of individuals in Knights and Knaves puzzles, applying logical inference and deduction.

- **Multiple Solutions:** Participants explore scenarios where multiple solutions may exist for a given puzzle, requiring careful consideration and analysis of statements.

- **Final Project:** The culmination of the project involves building a solver for Knights and Knaves puzzles, demonstrating proficiency in propositional logic and logical reasoning.

## Learning Objectives:

- Understand the rules and principles of the Knights and Knaves logic puzzle.
- Represent statements and logical relationships using propositional logic.
- Apply logical reasoning techniques to draw conclusions about the identities of individuals.
- Implement a solver capable of determining the identities of Knights and Knaves based on their statements.
- Analyze and handle scenarios with multiple solutions in Knights and Knaves puzzles.

The Knights project provides participants with practical experience in logical reasoning and problem-solving, equipping them with skills applicable to various domains requiring deductive reasoning and logical analysis.
