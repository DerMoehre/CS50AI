# Project 0a: Degrees

The [Degrees project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/0/degrees/) on Harvard's CS50 AI website focuses on implementing an AI agent capable of finding the shortest path of degrees of separation between two actors in the IMDb database. Participants explore graph search algorithms and data structures to efficiently traverse connections between actors and identify the shortest path between them.

## Key Components:

- **Introduction to Degrees of Separation:** The project introduces the concept of degrees of separation, where individuals are connected through a chain of relationships, such as actors who have appeared in the same movies.

- **IMDb Database Representation:** Participants learn to represent the IMDb database as a graph, where actors are nodes and movie collaborations represent edges between nodes.

- **Graph Search Algorithms:** Learners explore graph search algorithms such as breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the IMDb graph and find connections between actors.

- **Pathfinding:** The project covers techniques for finding the shortest path between two actors in the IMDb database, applying graph search algorithms to efficiently explore the connections between actors.

- **IMDb Data Processing:** Participants preprocess IMDb data to extract relevant information about actors, movies, and their collaborations, preparing it for graph-based search algorithms.

- **Final Project:** The culmination of the project involves implementing an AI agent capable of finding the shortest path of degrees of separation between two actors in the IMDb database, demonstrating proficiency in graph search and pathfinding algorithms.

## Learning Objectives:

- Understand the concept of degrees of separation and its application in finding connections between individuals.
- Represent the IMDb database as a graph data structure, with actors as nodes and movie collaborations as edges.
- Explore graph search algorithms such as BFS and DFS for traversing the IMDb graph and finding connections between actors.
- Implement pathfinding algorithms to find the shortest path between two actors in the IMDb database.
- Process IMDb data to extract relevant information and prepare it for graph-based search algorithms.

The Degrees project provides participants with practical experience in graph search and pathfinding algorithms, enabling them to implement AI agents capable of finding connections between individuals in large datasets.
