# Project 2b: Heredity

The [Heredity project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/2/heredity/) on Harvard's CS50 AI website explores probabilistic inference in genetics, focusing on predicting the likelihood of genetic traits being passed down through generations. Participants delve into Bayesian networks and probabilistic graphical models to analyze genetic inheritance patterns and make informed predictions.

## Key Highlights:

- **Introduction to Genetics and Heredity:** The project introduces fundamental concepts in genetics and heredity, explaining how traits are passed down through generations.

- **Bayesian Networks:** Participants learn about Bayesian networks as a graphical model for representing probabilistic relationships between variables, including genetic traits and family relationships.

- **Conditional Probability:** Learners explore conditional probability and its application in computing the likelihood of specific genetic traits given observed data and family histories.

- **Inference Algorithms:** The project covers inference algorithms, including exact inference methods like enumeration and approximate methods like likelihood weighting, for estimating probabilities in Bayesian networks.

- **Model Evaluation:** Participants evaluate the performance of their probabilistic models by comparing predicted probabilities with observed data and assessing model accuracy.

- **Final Project:** The culmination of the project involves building a probabilistic model capable of predicting the likelihood of genetic traits being passed down in a given family, demonstrating proficiency in probabilistic inference and genetics.

## Learning Objectives:

- Understand the principles of genetics and heredity.
- Represent genetic inheritance patterns using Bayesian networks.
- Apply conditional probability to compute likelihoods of genetic traits given observed data.
- Implement inference algorithms for probabilistic modeling and prediction.
- Evaluate probabilistic models and assess their accuracy in predicting genetic traits.

The Heredity project provides learners with practical experience in probabilistic inference and genetics, enabling them to make informed predictions about genetic traits based on family histories and observed data.
