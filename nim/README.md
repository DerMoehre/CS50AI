# Project 4b: Nim

The [Nim project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/4/nim/) on Harvard's CS50 AI website explores the classic game of Nim, focusing on developing AI agents capable of playing Nim strategically. Nim is a two-player mathematical game where players take turns removing objects from distinct heaps, with the goal of being the last player to remove an object.

## Key Components:

- **Introduction to Nim:** The project introduces Nim as a mathematical game of strategy, outlining the rules and objectives of the game.

- **Game Representation:** Participants learn to represent the game state and moves in Nim using data structures such as lists or arrays.

- **Game Strategies:** Learners explore various strategies for playing Nim, including optimal play and heuristic approaches based on game theory principles.

- **MiniMax Algorithm:** The project introduces the MiniMax algorithm, a fundamental concept in AI for decision-making in adversarial environments, and its application to Nim.

- **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** Participants learn about Alpha-Beta Pruning, a technique for optimizing the MiniMax algorithm, reducing the number of nodes evaluated during search.

- **Final Project:** The culmination of the project involves implementing a Nim-playing AI agent using MiniMax with Alpha-Beta Pruning, demonstrating strategic decision-making and game analysis skills.

## Learning Objectives:

- Understand the rules and strategies of the game Nim.
- Represent Nim game states and moves using appropriate data structures.
- Implement the MiniMax algorithm for decision-making in adversarial environments.
- Apply Alpha-Beta Pruning to optimize the MiniMax algorithm and improve performance.
- Develop an AI agent capable of playing Nim strategically and competitively.

The Nim project provides learners with insights into game theory, decision-making algorithms, and adversarial search techniques, offering practical experience in developing AI agents for strategic games.
