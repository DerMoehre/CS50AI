# Project 0b: Tic-Tac-Toe

The [Tic-Tac-Toe project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/0/tictactoe/) on Harvard's CS50 AI website explores the implementation of an AI agent capable of playing the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Participants delve into algorithmic problem-solving and game theory to develop an AI that can make strategic moves and compete against human players.

## Key Components:

- **Introduction to Tic-Tac-Toe:** The project introduces Tic-Tac-Toe as a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid, where players take turns marking Xs and Os in an attempt to create a winning combination.

- **Game Representation:** Participants learn to represent Tic-Tac-Toe boards as data structures, typically using arrays or matrices to store the state of the game.

- **Game Strategies:** Learners explore various strategies and algorithms for playing Tic-Tac-Toe effectively, including minimax, alpha-beta pruning, and heuristic evaluations.

- **AI Implementation:** The project covers the implementation of an AI agent capable of making intelligent moves in Tic-Tac-Toe, analyzing potential future states and selecting the best move based on game theory principles.

- **Human vs. AI Gameplay:** Participants implement functionality for human players to compete against the AI agent, providing a user-friendly interface for playing Tic-Tac-Toe.

- **Final Project:** The culmination of the project involves building a complete Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent, demonstrating proficiency in game development and artificial intelligence.

## Learning Objectives:

- Understand the rules and mechanics of the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- Represent Tic-Tac-Toe boards and game states using appropriate data structures.
- Explore algorithmic strategies for playing Tic-Tac-Toe effectively, including minimax and alpha-beta pruning.
- Implement an AI agent capable of making strategic moves in Tic-Tac-Toe using game theory principles.
- Develop a user interface for human players to interact with the Tic-Tac-Toe game and compete against the AI.

The Tic-Tac-Toe project provides participants with practical experience in game development and artificial intelligence, enabling them to build AI agents capable of playing strategic games and competing against human opponents.
