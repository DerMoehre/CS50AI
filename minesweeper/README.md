# Project 1b: Minesweeper

The [Minesweeper project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/1/minesweeper/) on Harvard's CS50 AI website explores the implementation of an AI agent capable of playing the classic game of Minesweeper. Participants dive into algorithmic problem-solving and constraint satisfaction techniques to develop an AI that can effectively flag and uncover safe squares while avoiding mines.

## Key Features:

- **Introduction to Minesweeper:** The project introduces Minesweeper as a single-player puzzle game where the player uncovers squares on a grid, aiming to avoid hidden mines while revealing safe squares.

- **Game Representation:** Participants learn to represent Minesweeper boards as data structures, including grids of squares with hidden mine placements and numerical clues indicating adjacent mines.

- **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs):** Learners explore constraint satisfaction techniques for solving Minesweeper, where constraints are derived from revealed squares and their adjacent clues.

- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** The project covers probabilistic reasoning in Minesweeper, where the likelihood of mines being present in certain squares is inferred based on revealed information.

- **Game Strategies:** Participants develop strategies for effectively flagging potential mines and uncovering safe squares, combining algorithmic approaches with heuristic reasoning.

- **Final Project:** The culmination of the project involves implementing an AI agent capable of playing Minesweeper, demonstrating proficiency in constraint satisfaction and strategic problem-solving.

## Learning Objectives:

- Understand the rules and mechanics of the Minesweeper game.
- Represent Minesweeper boards and game states using appropriate data structures.
- Apply constraint satisfaction techniques to solve Minesweeper puzzles.
- Utilize probabilistic reasoning to infer the presence of mines in unrevealed squares.
- Develop effective strategies for flagging mines and uncovering safe squares in Minesweeper.

The Minesweeper project provides participants with practical experience in algorithmic problem-solving and constraint satisfaction, enabling them to develop intelligent AI agents capable of playing Minesweeper with strategic proficiency.
