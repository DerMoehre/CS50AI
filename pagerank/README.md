# Project 2a: PageRank

The [PageRank project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/2/pagerank/) on Harvard's CS50 AI website explores the PageRank algorithm, a fundamental concept in web search and ranking algorithms. Participants delve into the principles of web graph analysis and develop algorithms to compute the importance scores of web pages based on their link structure.

## Key Components:

- **Introduction to PageRank:** The project introduces the PageRank algorithm and its significance in ranking web pages based on their relevance and importance.

- **Web Graph Representation:** Participants learn about representing web pages and their interconnections as a directed graph, where nodes represent web pages and edges represent hyperlinks between pages.

- **Random Walks and Probability:** Learners explore the concept of random walks on graphs and how it relates to the PageRank algorithm, understanding how probability distributions over nodes evolve during traversal.

- **Iterative Algorithm:** The project covers the iterative computation of PageRank scores, where each iteration updates the importance scores of web pages based on the link structure of the web graph.

- **Convergence and Stability:** Participants analyze the convergence properties of the PageRank algorithm and techniques for ensuring stability and accuracy of the computed PageRank scores.

- **Final Project:** The culmination of the project involves implementing the PageRank algorithm to compute the importance scores of web pages in a given web graph, demonstrating proficiency in web graph analysis and ranking algorithms.
